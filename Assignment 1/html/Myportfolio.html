<p>The language was announced in November 2009. It is used in &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  some of Google's production systems, as well as by other firms.[15]

Two major implementations exist:

Google's Go compiler, "gc", developed as open-source software. It targets various platforms including Linux, OS X, Windows, various BSD and Unix versions, and also (since 2015) mobile devices (including smartphones).[16]
A second compiler, gccgo, is a GCC frontend.[17][18]
The "gc" toolchain has been self-hosting since version 1.5.[19]

Go originated as an experiment by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson to design a new programming language that would resolve common criticisms of other languages while maintaining their positive characteristics. The developers envisaged the new language as:[20]

statically typed, scalable to large systems (as Java and C++)
productive and readable, without too many mandatory keywords and repetition[21] ("light on the page" like dynamic languages)
not requiring integrated development environments, but supporting them well
supporting networking and multiprocessing
In later interviews, all three of the language designers cited their shared dislike of C++'s complexity as a primary motivation for designing a new language.[22][23][24]

Google released Go 1.0 in March 2012.[25][26]

Language design[edit]
Go is recognizably in the tradition of C, but makes many changes to improve brevity, simplicity, and safety. Go consists of,

A syntax and environment adopting patterns more common in dynamic languages:[27]
Optional concise variable declaration and initialization through type inference (x := 0 not int x = 0; or var x = 0;).
Fast compilation times.[28]
Remote package management (go get)[29] and online package documentation.[30]
Distinctive approaches to particular problems:
Built-in concurrency primitives: light-weight processes (goroutines), channels, and the select statement.
